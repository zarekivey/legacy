# legacy

Hi! My name is Malachi Ivey! I've been programming for several years now and have written a ton of code in that time period. I've grown and learned a whole lot since the start of my programming career, so I've decided to compile all of my old projects into one repository. This way my 
Github isnt a mess of retired projects.

Keep in mind that these are **old** and **retired**. There's a lot of bad and incomplete code in here, and none of this is really meant to be run, so good luck if you try. Note - this repository does not contain anything that I've worked on recently or am actively working on.

Also, this isn't all of my old work. A lot has been lost, deleted, etc. so I wasn't able to include probably half of my previous works.

Enjoy! It's pretty funny when you get to the older stuff ðŸ˜†
